# Test Approach Rationale and Coverage Assessment

## Test Approach Rationale

The test approach for this project is primarily data-driven, ensuring a broad and flexible testing strategy that can easily adapt to various entities such as players, teams, and leagues. Here are the key rationales behind this approach:

- **Reusability**: By abstracting the test data from the test logic, we can reuse the same tests with different data sets. This reduces redundancy and makes maintenance easier.
- **Scalability**: The data-driven approach allows us to scale our tests by simply adding new data entries, making it easy to expand coverage without altering the test code.
- **Flexibility**: Testing different entities with one method (`test_entity()`) facilitates the inclusion of additional test scenarios, such as new app features or UI changes, with minimal adjustments.
- **Parameterization**: Utilizing `pytest.mark.parametrize` allows for a combination of datasets to be tested through the same test method, improving test clarity and focus.

## Coverage Assessment

The coverage of the tests focuses on key user journeys and interactions within the app, including:

- **Navigation**: Verifying the app's ability to navigate to the correct league, team, or player pages.
- **Page Verification**: Ensuring that each entity's page displays the expected information.
- **Sub-tab Interaction**: Confirming functionality of sub-tabs and the correctness of their data.
- **Back Navigation**: Assessing the back navigation to ensure it reliably returns the user to the previous context.

Current test coverage stands at an estimated ~80% of the core functionality related to entity verification and navigation. Critical paths are thoroughly tested, although some edge cases and error handling scenarios may require additional tests to reach more coverage.

Future steps include:
- Incorporating more complex user interactions.
- Adding negative test cases and error flow verifications.
- Implementing continuous integration to run tests on various device configurations.
